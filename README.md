👋 Hi, I'm Alex Peter

I'm a software developer with a strong passion for technology, open-source, and building tools that make people's lives easier. I specialize in full-stack development and enjoy solving complex problems with clean, scalable code.

From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how technology works—from tweaking computer settings to writing my first lines of code. That curiosity quickly turned into a career. Today, I write software that powers web applications, automates workflows, and brings ideas to life.

🛠️ What I Work With

I primarily work with JavaScript and Python, along with modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and Node.js for building fast, responsive applications. I’m also experienced with backend technologies, RESTful APIs, and databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. For version control and collaboration, Git and GitHub are my daily companions.

Here’s a snapshot of my core stack:

Languages: JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, SQL

Frameworks/Libraries: React, Node.js, Express, Next.js, Flask

Tools: Git, Docker, VS Code, Postman, Webpack

Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase

DevOps & Cloud: GitHub Actions, Netlify, Vercel

I'm constantly exploring new technologies and pushing my boundaries. Recently, I’ve been diving into Rust, GraphQL, and microservices architecture to better understand scalable backend systems.

🚀 Projects and Contributions

On GitHub, I love sharing personal projects, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open-source repositories. Some of the things I’ve built include:

A productivity app that helps users manage daily tasks with drag-and-drop simplicity.

An API that connects to a machine learning model to deliver smart predictions.

Custom developer tools designed to automate repetitive frontend tasks.

I believe in writing code that’s not just functional, but maintainable and well-documented—code that helps the next person (or future me) understand the "why" as well as the "how."

If you're into open-source or want to collaborate, feel free to check out my pinned repositories or drop me a message.

🌱 Always Learning

One of the best things about being a developer is that there’s always something new to learn. I make it a habit to stay updated with the latest trends in web development, whether it’s a new JavaScript framework or a fresh approach to CI/CD.

Right now, I'm particularly interested in:

Systems design and distributed computing

Functional programming and immutability

AI/ML integration with web apps

I'm also working on improving my writing and documentation skills, because great code deserves great docs.

🤝 Let’s Connect

I’m always open to feedback, learning from others, and working on meaningful projects. Whether you're a fellow developer, an open-source maintainer, or someone just getting started, I’d love to connect.

Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute ideas, or reach out if you're interested in collaborating. You can contact me via:
